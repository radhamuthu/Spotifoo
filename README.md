#   Spotifoo player 
##### A basic terminal application

 
## Introduction
A proof of concept to legalize the business of pirating music by creating a subscription service 
that allows you to stream music instead of downloading it from an unknown source.Spotifoo has a folder called assets with 2 sub folders.
One for the music files with a bunch of .mp3 files and another for the album art in .png files.Also provided with a file called data.txt with the 
information of the songs --the song name, artist, album, genre, file name, and album image.The app must read this file to display the list of songs and allow to select and play the song.
